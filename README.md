# FontTeX
### HTML, font-friendly math equations

FontTeX is a JavaScript library for rendering mathematical expressions on webpages using LaTeX syntax. It's able to produce expressions using any web font instead of forcing you to use the standard serif font that most math-rendering engines use. This works especially well when you're using a sans-serif font and want to include mathematical expression since it fits in well with the rest of the surrounding text.
